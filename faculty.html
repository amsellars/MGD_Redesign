                <p>
                    Fascinated and thoroughly confused by the concept of time, Bryan has worked with images, animation, and games throughout his career as a multimedia designer. "Games can bring all our mental, visual, tactile, and emotional elements together into one experience that opens new territory in our minds. That's a tool box we can really work with."

                <h2>Floyd Chapman</h2>
                <p>
                    Floyd is an archeological and historical illustrator/epigrapher, specializing in the art of the ancient world generally and the art of ancient Egypt specifically. He is one of the few people in the world who does full color reconstructions of ancient temple and tomb scenes that have lost most or all of their original pigment, so you can see how they were originally painted over three thousand years ago.
                    His education includes a high school diploma in art. He has an AA degree in history and a BA degree in Asian Studies, which was an inter-disciplinary degree with equal units in cultural anthropology and ancient history. Following the bachelors, he continued his studies in the same disciplines for 2 years of master's work.
                    He started his archeological work reconstruction work in 1990, all of which was done by hand, but made the conversion to digital after enrolling in the MGD program in 1998 at FRCC. After three years of study at Front Range he was offered a job as an adjunct instructor teaching Adobe Illustrator I and Illustrator II which he has been doing now for the last 9 and a half years.
                    In addition to teaching at FRCC, he is currently president of Ancient World Arts, LLC, President and Trustee of The Amarna Research Foundation, a Trustee on the board of the Egyptian Study Society and a scholar member of the International Association of Egyptologists.

                <p>
                    My success in the Multimedia Graphic Design Industry can clearly be credited to my vocational education from the Community College System.
                    I live the philosophy of vocational and technical training. I embrace the concept of what Front Range Community College and others like it have to offer when it comes to real-world, procedural training. Hands-on, state-of-the-art techniques, coupled with closely related electives, result in a well-rounded education—the type of education that not only prepared me but that will continue to prepare today's students as they enter the nation's competitive work force.
                    My expertise is in the print industry, so I teach: Photoshop I, Production Design, Packaging Design, and Electronic Prepress.

	                    Terry began her fascination with animation as a young child sitting on her father's lap watching Walt Disney tell the audience about time-lapse photography and the Plausible Impossible. This is what has driven her through the years to explore the possibilities of computer generated animation and video.
	                    Terry has been teaching in the MGD department since 2004. She currently teaching After Effects, which is a compositing program that can take elements from video, Photoshop, Painter, Illustrator, 3D, Flash, and sound and brings them together to create a totally new video. Flash is another program she teaches, this is where she makes the web non-static, an immersive interactive experience. Web 1 and Web 2 are also classes she teaches. We utilize Adobe's Dreamweaver, stressing html and CSS. Summer is playtime and so she teaches Photoshop 1, where she encourages students to learn to breathe with the program because nearly everything we do as graphic designers seems to touch Photoshop at some point.
